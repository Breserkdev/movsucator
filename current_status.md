# Movsucator Compiler Project Status

## Project Overview
Building a compiler targeting a MOV-only instruction set architecture (Movsucator), demonstrating that MOV is Turing-complete.

## Current Status (as of 2024-12-18)
1. Project Structure:
   - ✅ Project renamed from mov-only-compiler to Movsucator
   - ✅ Directory structure reorganized
   - ✅ Build system updated for new structure
   - ✅ LLVM integration configured

2. Core Infrastructure:
   - ✅ Basic target machine setup
   - ✅ Register info infrastructure
   - ✅ Instruction info infrastructure
   - ✅ Subtarget support structure
   - ✅ Basic MOV operations
   - ⬜ Frame handling implementation
   - ⬜ ABI implementations

3. MOV Implementation Status:
   - ✅ Basic MOV instruction definitions
   - ✅ Register-to-register MOV
   - ✅ Immediate-to-register MOV
   - ✅ Memory operations
   - ⬜ Conditional operations

4. Register Management:
   - ✅ Four registers defined (A, B, C, S)
   - ✅ Register class organization
   - ✅ Basic calling convention
   - ⬜ Register allocation strategy

5. TableGen Definitions:
   - ✅ Basic instruction formats
   - ✅ Register definitions
   - ✅ Processor model
   - ✅ Feature definitions
   - ⬜ Complex instruction patterns

## Next Steps
1. Implement remaining frame management functionality
2. Complete ABI implementation
3. Add support for conditional operations
4. Implement memory management operations
5. Add test cases for basic operations

## Known Issues
1. Build system needs proper error handling
2. Frame manager implementation incomplete
3. Memory operations need validation
