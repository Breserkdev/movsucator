# Movsucator Compiler Project Status

## Project Overview
Building a compiler targeting a MOV-only instruction set architecture (Movsucator), demonstrating that MOV is Turing-complete.

## Current Status (as of 2024-12-18)
1. Project Structure:
   - ✅ Project renamed from mov-only-compiler to Movsucator
   - ✅ Directory structure reorganized
   - ✅ Build system updated for new structure
   - ✅ LLVM integration configured
   - ✅ Include paths fixed for LLVM headers

2. Core Infrastructure:
   - ✅ Basic target machine setup
   - ✅ Register info infrastructure
   - ✅ Instruction info infrastructure
   - ✅ Subtarget support structure
   - ✅ Basic MOV operations
   - ✅ Frame handling implementation
   - ⚠️ ABI implementations (in progress)

3. MOV Implementation Status:
   - ✅ Basic MOV instruction definitions
   - ✅ Register-to-register MOV
   - ✅ Immediate-to-register MOV
   - ✅ Memory operations
   - ✅ MOV-based addition (via instruction patterns)
   - ✅ Fixed MOV_ADD naming conflicts in TableGen
   - ⚠️ Conditional operations (planned)

4. Register Management:
   - ✅ Four registers defined (A, B, C, S)
   - ✅ Register class organization
   - ✅ Basic calling convention
   - ✅ Register allocation strategy
   - ✅ Spill slot allocation support

5. Frame Management:
   - ✅ Stack frame initialization
   - ✅ Temporary memory allocation
   - ✅ Stack pointer management

   - ✅ Spill slot management

6. TableGen Definitions:
   - ✅ Basic instruction formats
   - ✅ Register definitions
   - ✅ Processor model
   - ✅ Feature definitions
   - ✅ MOV instruction patterns
   - ✅ Resolved naming conflicts between SDNodes and instructions

7. Current Issues:
   - ⚠️ Build system needs cleanup (LLVM integration)
   - ⚠️ Need to verify MOV-based arithmetic operations
   - ⚠️ Testing infrastructure needs expansion

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Instruction Lowering and Patterns:
   - Implement lowering for complex operations to MOV sequences
   - Add pattern matching for common instruction sequences
   - Optimize MOV instruction sequences

2. ABI Implementation:
   - Complete calling convention implementation
   - Add support for argument passing
   - Implement return value handling
   - Add support for stack unwinding

3. Conditional Operations:
   - Design MOV-based conditional execution
   - Implement comparison operations using MOV
   - Add branch instruction emulation
   - Implement conditional moves

4. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Add unit tests for frame manager
   - Create integration tests for function calls
   - Add regression tests for instruction lowering
   - Implement test suite for MOV patterns

5. Optimization Passes:
   - Add MOV-specific peephole optimizations
   - Implement stack frame optimization
   - Add register allocation improvements
   - Create instruction scheduling passes
