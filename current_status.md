# Movsucator Compiler Project Status

## Project Overview
Building a compiler targeting a MOV-only instruction set architecture (Movsucator), demonstrating that MOV is Turing-complete.

## Current Status (as of 2024-12-18)
1. Project Structure:
   - ✅ Project renamed from mov-only-compiler to Movsucator
   - ✅ Directory structure reorganized
   - ✅ Build system updated for new structure
   - ✅ LLVM integration configured
   - ✅ Include paths fixed for LLVM headers

2. Core Infrastructure:
   - ✅ Basic target machine setup
   - ✅ Register info infrastructure
   - ✅ Instruction info infrastructure
   - ✅ Subtarget support structure
   - ✅ Basic MOV operations
   - ⚠️ Frame handling implementation (in progress)
   - ⚠️ ABI implementations (in progress)

3. MOV Implementation Status:
   - ✅ Basic MOV instruction definitions
   - ✅ Register-to-register MOV
   - ✅ Immediate-to-register MOV
   - ✅ Memory operations
   - ⚠️ Conditional operations (planned)

4. Register Management:
   - ✅ Four registers defined (A, B, C, S)
   - ✅ Register class organization
   - ✅ Basic calling convention
   - ⚠️ Register allocation strategy (in progress)

5. TableGen Definitions:
   - ✅ Basic instruction formats
   - ✅ Register definitions
   - ✅ Processor model
   - ✅ Feature definitions
   - ⚠️ Complex instruction patterns (in progress)

## Next Steps
1. Complete frame manager implementation
2. Implement register allocation strategy
3. Add support for conditional operations
4. Add test cases for basic operations
5. Document the instruction set and ABI

## Known Issues
1. Build system needs proper error handling
2. Frame manager implementation incomplete
3. LLVM header paths need to be properly configured in build system

## Recent Updates
1. Fixed include paths for LLVM headers
2. Updated build system configuration
3. Corrected TargetRegistry and Triple header includes
4. Changed architecture registration to use UnknownArch temporarily
