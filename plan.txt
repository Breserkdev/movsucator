Current Status (as of 2024-12-18):
1. Core Infrastructure:
   [x] Basic target machine setup
   [x] Register info infrastructure
   [x] Instruction info infrastructure
   [x] Subtarget support structure
   [x] Basic MOV operations
   [ ] Frame handling implementation
   [ ] ABI implementations

2. MOV Implementation Status:
   [x] Basic MOV instruction definitions
   [x] Register-to-register MOV
   [x] Immediate-to-register MOV
   [x] Memory operations
   [ ] Conditional operations
   [ ] Frame setup/teardown sequences

3. Code Organization:
   [x] Header files properly structured
   [x] Implementation files created
   [x] Helper functions declared
   [x] TableGen definitions organized
   [ ] Build system fully configured

Priority Tasks:
1. HIGH - Complete Core Operations
   - [x] Implement register-to-register MOV
   - [x] Implement immediate-to-register MOV
   - [x] Add memory operation support
   - [x] Implement bit manipulation operations
   - [ ] Test basic MOV sequences

2. MEDIUM - Control Flow
   - [ ] Implement conditional operations
   - [ ] Add branch support using MOV
   - [ ] Test control flow sequences
   - [ ] Verify instruction selection

3. LOW - ABI and Frame Management
   - [ ] Complete frame setup/teardown
   - [ ] Implement platform-specific ABIs
   - [ ] Test function calls
   - [ ] Verify stack operations

Next Steps:
1. Complete Control Flow Support:
   - Implement conditional branch sequences
   - Add comparison operations
   - Test control flow
   - Verify branch patterns

2. Add Frame Management:
   - Implement frame setup/teardown
   - Add stack pointer management
   - Support function calls
   - Test frame operations

Progress:
[x] Basic target setup complete
[x] Register classes defined
[x] Instruction info structure ready
[x] Subtarget support added
[x] TableGen definitions organized
[x] Basic MOV operations implemented
[x] Bit manipulation operations implemented
[ ] Control flow working
[ ] Frame management complete
[ ] ABI support finished

Implementation Notes:
1. All member functions are const-correct
2. Helper functions organized in protected section
3. Stub implementations in place for future work
4. Frame allocation support added via allocateTempMem
5. TableGen files properly organized with clear dependency chain:
   - MovsucatorBase.td: Common definitions and base classes
   - MovsucatorRegisterInfo.td: Register definitions
   - MovsucatorInstrFormats.td: Instruction format classes
   - MovsucatorInstrInfo.td: Instruction definitions

Crucial Design Decisions:
1. TableGen Organization:
   - Using MovsucatorBase.td as foundation for all target definitions
   - Clear dependency chain from base to specific implementations
   - Follows LLVM best practices for target definition

2. Instruction Implementation:
   - All operations implemented using only MOV instructions
   - Complex operations broken down into MOV sequences:
     * Addition using bit-by-bit operations
     * Shifts using conditional MOVs
     * Logical operations using bit manipulation
   - Conditional operations use MOV for control flow

3. Register Management:
   - Dedicated registers for specific purposes (e.g., SP for stack)
   - Register classes organized by usage (GPR, SPR, PTR)
   - Callee-saved registers defined for ABI compliance

4. Bit Manipulation Strategy:
   - All bit operations implemented using MOV sequences
   - Each operation works on individual bits
   - Uses temporary registers for intermediate results
   - Avoids direct bit manipulation instructions

Build Status:
- CMake configuration in place
- Basic build infrastructure ready
- Current focus on implementing control flow
- Need to complete TableGen definitions

Testing Plan:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Basic MOV operations
   - Register allocation
   - Memory operations
   - Bit manipulation operations
   - Control flow sequences

2. Integration Tests:
   - Function calls
   - Stack operations
   - ABI compliance
   - Full programs
